## Custom Crafting and Recipes/Custom Plugins/Custom Items/Custom Plugin Instructions

1. Whenever you kill another player, you gain a heart and they lose a heart. 
2. Dieing by fall damage /mobs doesn't make you lose a heart. 
3. If you lose all your hearts and then you would be in spectator mode. You could be revived by voting done by all the other members of the SMP.
